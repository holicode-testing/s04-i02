# System Patterns: AI-Powered Learning Companion Platform

## Architectural Principles:
- **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive to facilitate independent development, testing, and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling to accommodate growing content libraries and user bases.
- **Resilience**: Implement fault tolerance and graceful degradation mechanisms to ensure high availability.
- **Flexibility**: Support a variety of backend and frontend technologies, allowing for technology evolution.
- **Testability**: Design components to be easily testable, promoting comprehensive end-to-end testing.
- **Security**: Incorporate security best practices at all layers of the application.

## High-Level Architecture:
- **Frontend Layer**: User interface for content consumption, interaction, and progress tracking.
- **Backend Services Layer**: Core business logic, content management, user management, and AI integration.
- **AI/ML Layer**: Dedicated services for LLM integration, contextual embeddings, summarization, question generation, and feedback.
- **Data Persistence Layer**: Storage for user data, learning paths, content metadata, and AI model data.
- **Content Ingestion Layer**: Mechanisms for processing and curating diverse educational materials.

## Key System Patterns:
- **Microservices/Modular Monolith**: Favor a modular approach for backend services, allowing for potential future decomposition into microservices.
- **API-First Design**: Define clear APIs for communication between frontend and backend, and between internal services.
- **Event-Driven Architecture (Future Consideration)**: For asynchronous processing and high-performance data access layers (not initial requirement).
- **Data Streaming (Future Consideration)**: For real-time content ingestion and processing.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to improve performance and reduce load on backend services and databases.
- **Observability**: Integrate logging, monitoring, and tracing to gain insights into system behavior and performance.

## Data Flow (Conceptual):
1. Content Ingestion -> Content Storage
2. User Interaction -> Frontend -> Backend Services
3. Backend Services -> AI/ML Layer (for summarization, Q&A, feedback)
4. AI/ML Layer -> Backend Services (responses)
5. Backend Services -> Data Persistence (progress, user data)
6. Data Persistence -> Backend Services (retrieve learning paths, content)
