# Retro Inbox: AI-Powered Learning Companion Platform

## Initial Setup Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Initial setup of HoliCode state files.
- **Root Cause**: None, standard initialization process.
- **Resolution**: Successfully created core state files based on provided business brief and HoliCode framework guidelines.
- **Pattern**: Followed the `state-init.md` workflow for systematic project setup.
- **Prevention**: N/A, this is a foundational step.

## Business Analyze Workflow Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Initial scope definition for a platform-level initiative.
- **Root Cause**: Ambiguity in whether to define the entire platform as a single feature or decompose into multiple epics from the outset.
- **Resolution**: User clarification led to the decision to define multiple epics, providing better separation of concerns and clearer deliverable chunks for a complex platform.
- **Pattern**: Engaged in an iterative clarification process using `ask_followup_question` to refine scope and gain user consensus on architectural decomposition. This highlights the importance of early-stage, high-level architectural decisions and their impact on subsequent planning.
- **Prevention**: For future platform-level initiatives, consider starting with the "Multiple Epics" option as a primary recommendation, detailing the benefits of early decomposition.

## Feature Decomposition Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Decomposing high-level epics into features.
- **Root Cause**: The epics were broad, requiring careful thought to define distinct, valuable features within each.
- **Resolution**: Successfully identified and documented 12 core features, distributing them across the four defined epics, ensuring each feature has clear business value and scope.
- **Pattern**: Applied a structured approach to feature definition, focusing on core functionalities and outlining in-scope/out-of-scope items, design rationale, and success metrics. This iterative process of refinement ensures comprehensive specification.
- **Prevention**: Pre-defining a more detailed "Feature Template" with explicit prompts for scope boundaries and design considerations could streamline this process further.

## Feature Prioritization Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Prioritizing features for incremental delivery using a "Walking Skeleton" approach.
- **Root Cause**: Initial workflow did not include explicit prioritization for incremental delivery or "steel thread" identification.
- **Resolution**: Collaborated with the user to prioritize features (P0/P1/P2), identify the "steel thread" (`FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001`), and note features that can be initially mocked/stubbed. This aligns the development with a minimum viable path to validate the core value proposition.
- **Pattern**: Adopted the "Walking Skeleton" approach, focusing on the shortest end-to-end path through the system that demonstrates core functionality. This is crucial for early validation and risk reduction.
- **Prevention**: The `business-analyze.md` workflow should be updated to include a prioritization step, potentially as part of the "Feature/Epic decision" phase, to explicitly define the "steel thread" and initial delivery increments.
