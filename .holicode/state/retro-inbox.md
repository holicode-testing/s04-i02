# Retro Inbox: AI-Powered Learning Companion Platform

## Initial Setup Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Initial setup of HoliCode state files.
- **Root Cause**: None, standard initialization process.
- **Resolution**: Successfully created core state files based on provided business brief and HoliCode framework guidelines.
- **Pattern**: Followed the `state-init.md` workflow for systematic project setup.
- **Prevention**: N/A, this is a foundational step.

## Business Analyze Workflow Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Initial scope definition for a platform-level initiative.
- **Root Cause**: Ambiguity in whether to define the entire platform as a single feature or decompose into multiple epics from the outset.
- **Resolution**: User clarification led to the decision to define multiple epics, providing better separation of concerns and clearer deliverable chunks for a complex platform.
- **Pattern**: Engaged in an iterative clarification process using `ask_followup_question` to refine scope and gain user consensus on architectural decomposition. This highlights the importance of early-stage, high-level architectural decisions and their impact on subsequent planning.
- **Prevention**: For future platform-level initiatives, consider starting with the "Multiple Epics" option as a primary recommendation, detailing the benefits of early decomposition.

## Feature Decomposition Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Decomposing high-level epics into features.
- **Root Cause**: The epics were broad, requiring careful thought to define distinct, valuable features within each.
- **Resolution**: Successfully identified and documented 12 core features, distributing them across the four defined epics, ensuring each feature has clear business value and scope.
- **Pattern**: Applied a structured approach to feature definition, focusing on core functionalities and outlining in-scope/out-of-scope items, design rationale, and success metrics. This iterative process of refinement ensures comprehensive specification.
- **Prevention**: Pre-defining a more detailed "Feature Template" with explicit prompts for scope boundaries and design considerations could streamline this process further.

## Feature Prioritization Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Prioritizing features for incremental delivery using a "Walking Skeleton" approach.
- **Root Cause**: Initial workflow did not include explicit prioritization for incremental delivery or "steel thread" identification.
- **Resolution**: Collaborated with the user to prioritize features (P0/P1/P2), identify the "steel thread" (`FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001`), and note features that can be initially mocked/stubbed. This aligns the development with a minimum viable path to validate the core value proposition.
- **Pattern**: Adopted the "Walking Skeleton" approach, focusing on the shortest end-to-end path through the system that demonstrates core functionality. This is crucial for early validation and risk reduction.
- **Prevention**: The `business-analyze.md` workflow should be updated to include a prioritization step, potentially as part of the "Feature/Epic decision" phase, to explicitly define the "steel thread" and initial delivery increments.

## Story Decomposition Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Decomposing the "AI-driven Content Summarization" feature into user stories.
- **Root Cause**: Decision point on story granularity (single comprehensive vs. multiple focused stories).
- **Resolution**: User opted for "3 focused stories" to allow for incremental delivery and clearer testing boundaries, starting with `STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001: Basic Content Summarization`.
- **Pattern**: Engaged the user to decide on story granularity, aligning with the principle of iterative refinement and user-guided development. This ensures stories are sized appropriately for the team's preferred development and testing methodology.
- **Prevention**: Incorporate a story granularity decision point directly into the functional analysis workflow for features with multiple distinct user flows.

## Story: Summarization with Length Preference Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Defining acceptance criteria for user-controlled summary length and format.
- **Root Cause**: Ensuring the system intelligently handles unfeasible requests and communicates effectively with the user.
- **Resolution**: Defined ACs to cover user choice, adherence to preferences, and graceful handling of unfeasible requests with clear user feedback.
- **Pattern**: Emphasized transparent communication with the user when AI capabilities have limitations, ensuring a positive user experience even when requests cannot be perfectly met.
- **Prevention**: For future features involving user preferences with AI, prioritize defining clear error handling and user feedback mechanisms early in the specification phase.

## Story: Viewing Summaries Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Defining acceptance criteria for displaying and associating generated summaries.
- **Root Cause**: Ensuring the summary is immediately visible, readable, and clearly linked to its source.
- **Resolution**: Defined ACs to cover immediate display, clear presentation, and minimal association with original content.
- **Pattern**: Prioritized user experience by making summaries immediately accessible and readable, reinforcing the value of the summarization feature.
- **Prevention**: For UI-focused stories, ensure ACs explicitly cover presentation, readability, and user flow (e.g., immediate display vs. requiring additional clicks).

## Technical Design Workflow Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Establishing the architectural foundation for the "AI-driven Content Summarization" feature.
- **Root Cause**: N/A, standard workflow execution.
- **Resolution**: Successfully generated all standard Technical Design documents (TD-001 to TD-007), covering System Architecture, Infrastructure, Technology Stack, Integration, Security, Performance, and Observability.
- **Pattern**: Followed the `technical-design.md` workflow, starting with architectural quality attribute prioritization and pattern selection (Modular Monolith) before detailing specific domains. This proactive approach ensures a solid foundation. The user's feedback emphasized prioritizing local development first before GCP deployment, which was incorporated into `TD-002`. This confirms the importance of continuous user feedback to refine architectural decisions.
- **Prevention**: Ensure that the `technical-design.md` workflow explicitly guides the agent to ask about initial deployment focus (local vs. cloud) early in the process to align with user priorities.

## Implementation Plan Workflow Learnings:
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Issue**: Breaking down the "steel thread" feature into detailed architectural and functional tasks.
- **Root Cause**: N/A, standard workflow execution.
- **Resolution**: Successfully generated 8 architectural tasks and 7 functional tasks based on comprehensive review of TDs and user stories. Tasks are detailed with clear descriptions, acceptance criteria, validation steps, and dependencies.
- **Pattern**: Followed the `implementation-plan.md` workflow, systematically processing technical design documents and user stories to create granular, actionable tasks. This iterative approach ensures comprehensive coverage and clear dependencies.
- **Prevention**: N/A, this is the desired process.
