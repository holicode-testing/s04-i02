## Component Status:
- **Core State Files**: All initialized and updated.
- **Epics**: Four core epics defined and documented.
- **Features**: Twelve core features defined, documented, and prioritized.
- **Stories**: All three stories for `FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001` created.

## Metrics (Initial Baseline - To be updated):
- **Documentation Coverage**: High (for initial setup, business analysis, feature definition, prioritization, and functional analysis)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (No code yet)
- **Uptime**: N/A (Not deployed)

## Next Steps (from `activeContext.md`):
- Handoff to `/technical-design.md` workflow for the next phase.
