# Progress: AI-Powered Learning Companion Platform

## Overall Status:
- **Project Phase**: Feature Prioritization Complete
- **Current Workflow**: Business Analyze (Completed)
- **Completion Percentage**: 40% (Feature Prioritization)

## Milestones:
- [x] HoliCode State Initialization:
    - [x] `projectbrief.md` created
    - [x] `productContext.md` created
    - [x] `systemPatterns.md` created
    - [x] `techContext.md` created
    - [x] `activeContext.md` created
    - [x] `retro-inbox.md` created
    - [x] `github-mapping.md` created
    - [x] `delegationContext.md` created
    - [x] `gitContext.md` created
    - [x] Initial `.gitignore` created
    - [x] Initial Git commit (`c3a4283`)
- [x] Business Analysis:
    - [x] `productContext.md` updated with refined details.
    - [x] Decision made to decompose into multiple epics.
    - [x] Four Epic specification files created: `EPIC-CM-001`, `EPIC-AI-002`, `EPIC-PA-003`, `EPIC-EA-004`.
    - [x] `WORK_SPEC.md` updated with new epic links and hierarchy.
    - [x] `activeContext.md` updated.
    - [x] `retro-inbox.md` updated with learnings.
- [x] Feature Definition:
    - [x] Twelve Feature specification files created, decomposing the four Epics.
    - [x] `WORK_SPEC.md` updated with new feature links.
    - [x] `activeContext.md` updated.
    - [x] `retro-inbox.md` updated with learnings.
- [x] Feature Prioritization:
    - [x] Features marked with priorities (P0/P1/P2) in `WORK_SPEC.md`.
    - [x] Identified `FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001` as the "steel thread" feature.
    - [x] Noted features that can be mocked/stubbed initially.
    - [x] `activeContext.md` updated.
    - [x] `retro-inbox.md` updated with learnings.

## Component Status:
- **Core State Files**: All initialized and updated.
- **Epics**: Four core epics defined and documented.
- **Features**: Twelve core features defined, documented, and prioritized.

## Metrics (Initial Baseline - To be updated):
- **Documentation Coverage**: High (for initial setup, business analysis, feature definition, and prioritization)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (No code yet)
- **Uptime**: N/A (Not deployed)

## Next Steps (from `activeContext.md`):
- Prepare for the next phase: Functional Analysis, which will involve decomposing these Features into more detailed Stories, starting with the P0 features.
