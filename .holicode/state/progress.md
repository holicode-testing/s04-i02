## Component Status:
- **Core State Files**: All initialized and updated.
- **Epics**: Four core epics defined and documented.
- **Features**: Twelve core features defined, documented, and prioritized.
- **Stories**: All three stories for `FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001` created.
- **Technical Design Documents**: All 7 standard TDs for `FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001` completed.
- **Tasks**: All 15 tasks for `FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001` created and documented.

## Metrics (Initial Baseline - To be updated):
