# Active Context: AI-Powered Learning Companion Platform

## Current Focus:
Initializing the HoliCode project structure and core state files for the "AI-Powered Learning Companion Platform". This involves setting up foundational documentation that defines the project's purpose, architectural patterns, technical considerations, and initial progress tracking.

## Recent Changes:
- Created `projectbrief.md`: Defined project name, primary goal, target users, flexible tech stack, and high-level success metrics.
- Created `productContext.md`: Detailed the problem statement, target users, key high-level features, and business value.
- Created `systemPatterns.md`: Outlined architectural principles, high-level architecture layers, and key system patterns.
- Created `techContext.md`: Documented project constraints, initial technology considerations, development environment setup, and future tech considerations.

## Immediate Next Steps:
- Continue initializing remaining core state files: `retro-inbox.md`, `github-mapping.md`, `delegationContext.md`, `gitContext.md`.
- Set up Git repository and create initial commit.
- Initialize `progress.md` as the final step of state initialization.
- Confirm completion of the state initialization process.

## Open Questions:
- Confirmation of specific tech stack choices for initial implementation.
- Detailed requirements for content ingestion and curation mechanisms.
- Specific LLM integrations and data privacy considerations.
