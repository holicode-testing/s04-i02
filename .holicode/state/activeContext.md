# Active Context: AI-Powered Learning Companion Platform

## Current Focus:
Completed defining technical specifications for the "AI-driven Content Summarization" feature, establishing the architectural foundation and key design decisions.

## Recent Changes:
- `productContext.md` updated with refined problem statement, goals, stakeholders, constraints, and SMART success metrics.
- Four new Epic specification files created:
    - `EPIC-CM-001: Content Management & Curation`
    - `EPIC-AI-002: AI-Powered Learning & Feedback`
    - `EPIC-PA-003: Personalization & Adaptive Learning Paths`
    - `EPIC-EA-004: Engagement & Analytics`
- `WORK_SPEC.md` updated to include the new Epics and a revised hierarchy map reflecting the Epic-Feature-Story-Task structure.
- Twelve new Feature specification files created, decomposing the four Epics.
- `WORK_SPEC.md` updated to include the new Features, marked with priorities (P0/P1/P2), identified the "steel thread" feature, and noted features that can be mocked/stubbed initially. The "steel thread" feature is `FEATURE-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001: AI-driven Content Summarization`.
- Created `STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001: Basic Content Summarization` for the AI-driven Content Summarization feature.
- `WORK_SPEC.md` updated to link `STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001`.
- Created `STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-002: Summarization with Length Preference` for the AI-driven Content Summarization feature.
- `WORK_SPEC.md` updated to link `STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-002`.
- Created `STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-003: Viewing Summaries` for the AI-driven Content Summarization feature.
- `WORK_SPEC.md` updated to link `STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-003`.
- Created and linked Technical Design Documents for the AI-driven Content Summarization feature:
    - `TD-001: System Architecture Overview`
    - `TD-002: Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture`
    - `TD-003: Technology Stack Decisions`
    - `TD-004: Integration & API Architecture`
    - `TD-005: Security & Compliance Architecture`
    - `TD-006: Performance & Scalability Architecture`
    - `TD-007: Observability & Operations Architecture`
- `WORK_SPEC.md` updated to include links to all new Technical Design Documents.

## Immediate Next Steps:
- Implementation Plan for "AI-driven Content Summarization" feature completed.
- Created 8 architectural tasks and 7 functional tasks, detailed in `.holicode/specs/tasks/TASK-001.md` through `.holicode/specs/tasks/TASK-F-007.md`.
- Updated `WORK_SPEC.md` with links to all new task specifications.
- Ready to proceed with the implementation phase.
- Next step: Execute `/task-implement.md` workflow.

## Open Questions:
- Confirmation of technical design approval by stakeholders.
