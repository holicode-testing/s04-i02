## Challenges Faced
- **Nx/PNPM `EACCES` permission error**: Initial `npm install -g nx` failed due to permissions. **Resolution**: Used `sudo npm install -g nx`.
- **Incorrect `create-nx-workspace` usage**: Initial attempt to create workspace and apps simultaneously failed. **Resolution**: Used `nx init` then `nx generate` commands.
- **PNPM `ERR_PNPM_ADDING_TO_ROOT`**: `pnpm add -D` failed without `-w` flag. **Resolution**: Explicitly used `-w` flag.
- **App-specific dependencies for Dockerization**: User requested `react`, `react-dom` and web-specific `devDependencies` to be in `apps/web/package.json` for Dockerization. This led to complex `package.json` modifications and misunderstandings about hoisting. **Resolution**: Moved dependencies to app-specific `package.json` files and then carefully managed root `package.json` to include only truly shared/Nx-critical dependencies. This required several iterations and user feedback.
- **Module resolution errors (`Cannot find module 'vite'`, `Cannot find module 'typescript-eslint'`)**: Persistent errors after moving dependencies. This was a significant struggle due to `pnpm`'s strict linking and Nx's plugin resolution. **Resolution**: Explicitly ensured `vite`, `eslint`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `jest`, `ts-jest`, `ts-node`, `typescript`, `@types/jest`, `@types/node` were present in root `package.json`. The `nx.json` was configured to automatically sync TypeScript changes.
- **Incorrect `directory` flag for `api` and `shared` generation**: Initial `nx generate` commands used `--directory=apps` or `--directory=libs`, leading to incorrect nesting. **Resolution**: Used `--directory=apps/api` and `--directory=libs/shared` respectively.
- **`__dirname` error in `api` Jest config**: `ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined in ES module scope`. **Resolution**: Modified `apps/api/jest.config.ts` to use `jest.preset.cjs` and `ts-jest` based on user's reference project.
- **`web` Jest test failure (`SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`)**: Caused by mismatch between `tsconfig.base.json` (ESNext modules) and Jest's CommonJS context. **Resolution**: Aligned `apps/web/tsconfig.spec.json` (explicitly setting `module: "commonjs"`) and `apps/web/jest.config.ts` with the reference project's configuration (using `@swc/jest` with specific `jsc` options).
- **`customConditions` TypeScript error**: Conflict between `tsconfig.base.json` and `apps/web/tsconfig.spec.json` due to `customConditions` in `tsconfig.base.json`. **Resolution**: Fully aligned `tsconfig.base.json` with the reference project, which does not contain `customConditions`.
- **Missing test setup files**: `apps/web/src/test-env.ts` and `apps/web/src/test-setup.ts` were missing. **Resolution**: Created empty placeholder files.
- **`console.warn` in `apps/web/src/app/app.spec.tsx`**: **Resolution**: Addressed by removing the global flag from the `RegExp` in the test file.
- **Git workflow issues**: Initial commit on `main`, then needing to reset and create a new branch. **Resolution**: Performed `git reset HEAD~1`, created `feat/TASK-001-setup-nx-monorepo` branch, re-staged and re-committed changes.
- **Non-interactive PR creation**: `gh pr create` prompted for interaction. **Resolution**: Pushed the feature branch and set upstream before creating the PR.

## Critical Decisions
- **Aligning with reference project configurations**: Decided to meticulously copy configuration details from the user-provided reference project (`reference-s04-i01`) for `tsconfig.*.json`, `jest.config.ts`, and `jest.preset.cjs`. Rationale: The reference project provided a known working state for a complex Nx/TypeScript/Jest/pnpm setup, which proved invaluable in resolving persistent and intertwined configuration issues. This was a critical pivot from attempting to debug and fix errors incrementally without a clear blueprint.
- **Prioritizing Nx's core tooling requirements**: Made the decision to keep certain critical development dependencies (like `vite`, `typescript`, `eslint` and its related plugins, `jest` and its related plugins) at the root `package.json`, even when the goal was Dockerization-friendly app-specific `package.json` files. Rationale: Nx's internal graph processing and plugin resolution mechanisms require these tools to be globally resolvable within the monorepo, overriding the strict app-level dependency isolation for build-time tools.

## Learnings & Insights
### Technical
- **Nx/pnpm module resolution complexity**: The most significant learning was the intricate nature of module resolution in Nx monorepos when combined with `pnpm`'s strict linking. Issues like "Cannot find module" can persist even when packages are theoretically present, requiring deep understanding of how Nx plugins resolve dependencies and how `pnpm`'s `node_modules` structure affects this. Explicitly adding core monorepo tooling to the root `package.json` and ensuring `tsconfig` alignment is crucial.
- **TypeScript module system interplay**: The `module: "esnext"` in `tsconfig.base.json` combined with Jest's CommonJS context for tests led to `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`. Correcting this required explicit `module: "commonjs"` in `tsconfig.spec.json` and careful configuration of Jest's transform.
- **Jest configuration nuances**: Understanding how `jest.preset.cjs` (for CommonJS context) and specific `transform` settings (`ts-jest` vs `@swc/jest`) impact test execution and module resolution was key.
- **Git workflow for monorepo tasks**: Best practices for Git in a monorepo (e.g., creating feature branches *before* making substantial changes and committing) are vital to avoid complex history rewriting.

### Process
- **Importance of meticulous comparison**: The user's repeated emphasis on comparing files "one by one" with the reference project was the most effective strategy for resolving persistent configuration issues. My initial attempts to fix incrementally or make assumptions led to prolonged debugging.
- **Value of clear, specific feedback**: The user's concise and precise feedback (e.g., "WRONG directory", "NOOO, I neeed deps with THE APP!", "without POSITIONAL `api`") was instrumental in guiding the problem-solving process. This direct communication is invaluable.
- **Avoiding premature optimization/generalization**: My attempt to unify Jest config with `ts-jest` for both `api` and `web` was a premature generalization that contradicted the reference's working `@swc/jest` setup for `web`. Sticking to the working reference is better until a deeper understanding is gained.

### Meta-Observations
- **Complexity of monorepo setup**: Setting up a modern TypeScript monorepo with Nx, pnpm, and different application types (Node.js backend, React frontend) is inherently complex and prone to subtle configuration mismatches.
- **AI's learning curve**: My struggle in this task highlights the AI's learning curve with highly interconnected and environment-specific configurations. The iterative feedback loop with the user was essential for navigating this complexity.
- **Reference project as AI training data**: The reference project effectively served as dynamic "training data" for the AI, allowing it to learn working patterns and configurations in a live environment.

## Deliverables
- Fully configured Nx monorepo with `api` (NestJS), `web` (React), and `shared` library.
- Working `nx build api`, `nx build web`, `nx test api`, `nx test web` commands.
- Aligned `package.json` files (root and `apps/web`) for Dockerization.
- Aligned `tsconfig.base.json`, `apps/web/tsconfig.json`, `apps/web/tsconfig.spec.json`.
- Aligned `apps/api/jest.config.ts`, `apps/web/jest.config.ts`, `jest.preset.cjs`.
- Creation of `apps/web/src/test-env.ts` and `apps/web/src/test-setup.ts`.
- `console.warn` in `apps/web/src/app/app.spec.tsx` addressed.
- Verified `.gitignore` contents.
- Git commit for `TASK-001` on a new feature branch (`feat/TASK-001-setup-nx-monorepo`).
- PR created: `https://github.com/holicode-testing/s04-i02/pull/5`.

## Impact Assessment
- **Immediate Impact**: `TASK-001` is complete, providing a solid foundational monorepo setup. All basic build and test processes are validated.
- **Long-term Value**: The aligned configurations will simplify future development, reduce configuration-related bugs, and provide a stable environment for implementing new features. The Dockerization-friendly `package.json` structure is crucial for deployment.
- **Framework Evolution**: This session provides rich data for improving future Nx/pnpm setup workflows and error diagnostics within the framework.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with `TASK-002: Configure Code Quality Tools (ESLint, Prettier) in Monorepo`.
- Monitor for any new module resolution issues as more dependencies and configurations are added.

## Recommendations
- **Improved Nx/PNPM setup guidance**: The initial Nx setup process was particularly challenging due to `pnpm`'s strictness and Nx's resolution expectations. Provide more explicit guidance or automated checks for `pnpm` workspace setup, especially regarding which dependencies *must* reside at the root `package.json` for Nx's internal tooling.
- **Enhanced error diagnostics**: For module resolution errors, provide more specific guidance on common `pnpm` pitfalls and potential `tsconfig` mismatches.
- **Automated Git workflow for PRs**: The manual Git steps (resetting, branching, committing) were complex. Automate this process within the framework for future PR creations, ensuring adherence to best practices (e.g., creating feature branches *before* committing task-related changes).
- **Clearer PR template instructions**: Ensure PR template placeholders are very specific about required content, including how to summarize changes and testing.
