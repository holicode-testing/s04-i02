## Initial Context & Objectives

- **Initial Request/Task**: Implement `TASK-002: Configure Code Quality Tools (ESLint, Prettier) in Monorepo`.
- **Explicit Objectives**:
  - Configure ESLint to lint TypeScript files in `api` and `web` applications.
  - Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting.
  - Integrate ESLint and Prettier with Nx (`nx lint`, `nx format`).
  - Ensure no linting/formatting errors on generated Nx apps.
  - Configure VSCode settings for auto-fix on save.
  - Create a Pull Request for the changes.
- **Implicit Objectives**: Follow best practices for monorepo development (e.g., pnpm workspace root dependencies), adhere to PR templating, and avoid interactive CLI prompts.
- **Context Available at Start**:
  - `.holicode/specs/tasks/TASK-002.md` defining the task and acceptance criteria.
  - `.holicode/state/techContext.md` outlining preferred technologies (Nx, React, Node.js).
  - Existing `eslint.config.mjs` and `package.json`.
  - Knowledge of HoliCode framework structure and workflows.
- **Assumptions Made**: Initial assumption was that standard Nx tooling and existing `eslint.config.mjs` would be straightforward to extend for Prettier integration. Assumed standard PR creation script would be available as per workflow documentation.

## Challenges & Resolutions

- **Challenge 1: `pnpm` workspace dependency installation**: Initially attempted `pnpm add -D ...`, which caused a warning.
  - **Resolution**: User feedback guided the use of `-w` flag (`pnpm add -D ... -w`) to explicitly add to workspace root.
- **Challenge 2: ESLint/Prettier integration errors**: Encountered "Could not find plugin 'prettier'" and "prettier is not defined" errors after initial config changes.
  - **Resolution**: Explicitly registered `prettierPlugin` in the ESLint `plugins` block and corrected variable reference from `prettier.configs` to `prettierPlugin.configs`.
- **Challenge 3: Linting/Formatting issues not fully fixed by `nx format write`**: Initial `nx format write` didn't clean all lint errors, especially for `web` app.
  - **Resolution**: Explicitly ran `pnpm nx lint api --fix` and `pnpm nx lint web --fix` to ensure all fixable issues were resolved.
- **Challenge 4: VSCode auto-fix on save**: Initial task completion didn't include VSCode config.
  - **Resolution**: User feedback prompted adding comprehensive settings to `.vscode/settings.json` for auto-formatting and ESLint auto-fix.
- **Challenge 5: PR Creation Script Missing/Incorrect**: Assumed `scripts/pr/create.sh` existed and was usable.
  - **Resolution**: Realized script was not present in project. Pivoted to direct `gh pr create` command.
- **Challenge 6: PR Template Location/Usage**: User insisted on following a PR template, but initial searches for `templates/github` and `.holicode/handoff/templates` yielded no results. Initial attempt at creating a template was a pre-filled description.
  - **Resolution**: Created a generic `pull_request_template.md` in `.github/` with placeholders. Then, programmatically filled this template and passed it via `gh pr create --body-file`.
- **Challenge 7: `gh pr create` interactivity**: `gh pr create` prompted for upstream branch push.
  - **Resolution**: User feedback guided to push the branch first with `git push --set-upstream origin ...` to avoid interactivity.

## Key Decisions & Rationale

- **Decision**: Add shared dev dependencies to workspace root.
  - **Rationale**: Follows pnpm monorepo best practices for common tools like Prettier and ESLint.
- **Decision**: Use flat ESLint config and integrate Prettier as a plugin.
  - **Rationale**: Modern ESLint approach, allows Prettier to fix formatting issues via ESLint.
- **Decision**: Implement VSCode auto-fix on save.
  - **Rationale**: Improves developer experience and ensures consistent code style automatically.
- **Decision**: Manually create PR via `gh pr create` instead of relying on a non-existent script.
  - **Rationale**: Pragmatic approach to complete the task when an expected automation script is missing.
- **Decision**: Create `.github/pull_request_template.md` and programmatically fill it.
  - **Rationale**: Adheres to user's request for PR templating, even if HoliCode-specific templates weren't found. Automates the filling process to avoid manual interaction.

## Learning & Insights

### Technical Learnings

- **ESLint Flat Config**: Understanding explicit plugin registration and order of rules (e.g., `prettierConfig` last).
- **pnpm workspaces**: Importance of `-w` flag for root-level dependency management.
- **Nx CLI**: Distinction between `nx` and `pnpm nx`, and proper use of `--fix` flag for linting.
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: How `gh pr create` interacts with git upstream and how to avoid interactive prompts by pre-pushing. Also, the `--body-file` option for programmatic PR body creation.
- **VSCode `settings.json`**: Key settings for `editor.formatOnSave`, `editor.defaultFormatter`, `eslint.probe`, `eslint.validate`, `eslint.format.enable`, and `editor.codeActionsOnSave` for robust auto-fixing.

### Process Learnings

- **Importance of clear error messages**: The detailed ESLint errors helped pinpoint configuration issues.
- **Iterative Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex issues (like ESLint configuration or PR creation) into smaller, fixable steps.
- **User Feedback is Crucial**: User interventions were critical in correcting course (pnpm flag, PR templating, git upstream). This highlights the value of continuous communication and feedback loops.
- **Framework Documentation vs. Reality**: The discrepancy between documented workflow scripts (`scripts/pr/create.sh`) and the actual project structure necessitated adapting the approach. This points to a potential need for better synchronization or clarity in documentation for framework users.

### Meta-Observations

- **Robustness of `gh` CLI**: Despite initial hiccups, `gh` CLI proved powerful for programmatic Git/GitHub operations.
- **Complexity of Monorepo Tooling**: Even basic setup of linting/formatting in an Nx monorepo involves multiple layers of configuration (root ESLint, app-specific ESLint, Prettier, Nx targets, VSCode settings).
- **Value of Detailed Task Definitions**: `TASK-002.md` provided clear acceptance criteria, which guided the implementation and validation steps.

## Deliverables & Outcomes

- `prettier.config.mjs` created.
- `eslint.config.mjs` modified and corrected.
- `.vscode/settings.json` configured.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` created (generic template).
- `.github/pr_body.md` created (temporary file for PR description).
- All linting and formatting issues resolved in `api` and `web` applications.
- Git branch `feat/task-002-code-quality-tools` created and pushed.
- Pull Request created on GitHub: https://github.com/holicode-testing/s04-i02/pull/6

## Impact Assessment

- **Immediate Value Delivered**: Successfully configured essential code quality tools, improving developer experience and ensuring code consistency.
- **Long-term Implications**: Establishes a foundation for maintainable and high-quality codebase in the monorepo. The configured auto-fix on save will reduce manual formatting efforts.
- **Dependencies Created or Resolved**: Resolved dependencies on manual linting/formatting. Introduced dependency on `prettier`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-prettier`.
- **Technical Debt Introduced or Paid Down**: Paid down technical debt related to inconsistent code style and lack of automated formatting.

## Follow-up Actions

- User review and merge of PR #6.
- Deletion of temporary `.github/pr_body.md` file.
- Potentially integrate the `gh pr create` logic into a reusable project-specific script if this pattern is to be repeated frequently, or if the HoliCode framework updates its own scripts.

## Recommendations for Framework Evolution

- **Workflow Script Availability**: Ensure that workflow documentation (`.clinerules/holicode.md` and related `.md` files) accurately reflects the availability and required usage (e.g., arguments, paths) of helper scripts like `scripts/pr/create.sh`. If scripts are meant to be provided by the framework, they should be present or clearly indicate how to obtain/install them.
- **PR Templating Guidance**: Provide clearer guidance or automated tools for setting up and using PR templates within the project, beyond just common GitHub conventions, especially if custom HoliCode templates are expected.
- **Error Handling in Workflows**: Improve workflow's ability to recover from common CLI errors (e.g., "command not found" for `nx`, interactive prompts) by providing more robust error detection and automated recovery/retries.
- **Nx Integration Patterns**: Potentially include more detailed patterns for Nx-specific configurations (e.g., how to ensure `nx format write` affects all relevant files consistently without needing `--fix` on `lint` command explicitly).
