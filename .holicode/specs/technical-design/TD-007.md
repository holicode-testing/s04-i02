# TD-007: Observability & Operations Architecture

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the observability and operations architecture for the AI-driven Content Summarization service. It focuses on enabling effective monitoring, logging, and alerting for the MVP, with a clear path for integration with GCP's comprehensive operational tools in future iterations.

## Logging Strategy and Aggregation
- **Local Development:**
    - **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) to output logs in JSON format. This facilitates easier parsing and analysis.
    - **Console Output/File:** Logs will be output to the console during development and potentially to local files for debugging.
- **Future GCP Deployment:**
    - **Cloud Logging:** All application logs (stdout/stderr from Cloud Run containers) will be automatically ingested by GCP Cloud Logging.
    - **Log Export:** Critical logs can be exported to BigQuery for advanced analytics or to Cloud Storage for long-term archival.
    - **Log Levels:** Implement standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) to control verbosity.

## Metrics and Monitoring Approach
- **Local Development:**
    - **Basic Metrics:** Simple in-application metrics can be exposed (e.g., using a Prometheus client library if a local Prometheus instance is run via docker-compose) for tracking basic request counts, error rates, and latency.
- **Future GCP Deployment:**
    - **Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver Monitoring):**
        - **Built-in Metrics:** Leverage Cloud Run's built-in metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, request count, latency, error rates).
        - **Custom Metrics:** Instrument the application to export custom metrics for business-specific KPIs (e.g., number of summarization requests, LLM API call duration, content length processed).
    - **Dashboards:** Create custom dashboards in Cloud Monitoring to visualize key metrics and service health.

## Distributed Tracing Implementation
- **Initial MVP:** Not a primary focus for the MVP due to added complexity. Direct function calls within the modular monolith reduce the need for distributed tracing initially.
- **Future Consideration:** If the monolith is decomposed into multiple services or complex asynchronous workflows are introduced, distributed tracing will become essential.
    - **Approach:** Integrate with OpenTelemetry or a similar tracing framework. For GCP, this would involve sending traces to Cloud Trace.

## Alerting and Incident Response
- **Local Development:** Basic console logging for errors. Developers are responsible for monitoring local application health.
- **Future GCP Deployment:**
    - **Cloud Monitoring Alerting:** Configure alerts based on predefined thresholds for key metrics (e.g., high error rates, increased latency, low resource availability).
    - **Notification Channels:** Integrate with notification channels (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack, email) to notify on-call teams of incidents.
    - **Error Reporting:** Use GCP Error Reporting to automatically collect and analyze application errors, providing real-time insights into issues.

## Operational Dashboards and Runbooks
- **Initial MVP:** No formal operational dashboards or runbooks. Developers will rely on local logs and direct observation.
- **Future GCP Deployment:**
    - **Cloud Monitoring Dashboards:** Comprehensive dashboards will be created to provide a consolidated view of service health, performance, and operational status.
    - **Runbooks:** Document common operational procedures, troubleshooting guides, and incident response steps to facilitate efficient issue resolution.

## Health Checks
- **HTTP Health Endpoint:** Implement a simple HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/health`) that returns a 200 OK status if the application is running and responsive. This can be used by load balancers or container orchestration platforms.
- **Dependency Checks:** The health check can optionally include checks for external dependencies (e.g., reachability of LLM APIs), but for the MVP, a basic liveness check is sufficient.
