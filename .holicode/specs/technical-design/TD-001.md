# TD-001: System Architecture Overview

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Lead Architect:** Cline  

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the system architecture for the AI-driven Content Summarization feature, adopting a Modular Monolith pattern. This approach prioritizes maintainability, clean architecture, and rapid development for the MVP, while leveraging GCP Cloud Run for scalable deployment. It integrates with external LLM and embedding APIs.

## Architectural Quality Attributes
### Performance
- **Requirements**: For MVP, focus on functional correctness and reasonable response times for summarization requests. Optimize critical paths post-MVP based on observed bottlenecks.
- **Architectural Approach**: Leverage efficient API calls to LLMs. Initial focus on single-request summarization, with potential for batch processing or asynchronous handling for larger volumes in later stages.
### Scalability  
- **Requirements**: The system should be able to handle increasing summarization requests and potential growth in user base.
- **Architectural Approach**: Deploy as a Modular Monolith on GCP Cloud Run, which provides automatic scaling based on request load. Modules within the monolith can be designed with clear boundaries to facilitate future extraction into independent services if specific scaling needs arise.
### Security
- **Requirements**: Secure handling of API keys for LLM services, protection of user data (if any is processed or stored), and secure communication.
- **Architectural Approach**: Implement robust secrets management for API keys (e.g., GCP Secret Manager). Ensure all communications are encrypted (HTTPS). Input validation for summarization requests to prevent common vulnerabilities.
### Reliability
- **Requirements**: High availability for the summarization service. Graceful handling of external API failures.
- **Architectural Approach**: Design with retry mechanisms for external LLM API calls. Implement proper error logging and monitoring. Cloud Run's managed service inherently provides high availability and fault tolerance.
### Maintainability
- **Requirements**: Clean, modular codebase that is easy to understand, test, and evolve. Support for a fast-paced development team.
- **Architectural Approach**: Modular Monolith with well-defined module boundaries and interfaces. Adherence to clean architecture principles (e.g., separation of concerns, dependency inversion). Emphasis on clear coding standards, comprehensive testing, and reasonable DevOps practices.

## System Architecture Pattern
**Chosen Pattern:** Modular Monolith
**Rationale:** This pattern best fits the current priorities of maintainability, clean architecture, and rapid development for an early MVP. It offers a balance between development speed and future scalability, allowing for a structured codebase that can evolve. The choice aligns with the fast-paced, experienced team's preference for agile development and leverages GCP Cloud Run's capabilities for scalable deployment.

## System Boundaries
- **Internal Systems:** Initial components will include summarization logic, API integration layers, and potentially a simple persistence layer for summaries or user preferences (if required by future stories).
- **External Integrations:**
    - LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, OpenRouter, LM Studio - OpenAI API compatible) for content summarization.
    - Embedding/Reranking APIs (e.g., for llama.cpp, ollama, lm server) for text processing and context understanding.
- **User Interfaces:** The summarization service will expose an API (e.g., RESTful) for consumption by future frontend applications (web, mobile, etc.) or other services.
- **Data Sources:** Content to be summarized will be provided via API requests. Any generated summaries or related metadata might be stored in a suitable database.

## Component Overview
[High-level component diagram and descriptions will be refined as further TDs are developed. Initially, this will involve:]
- **API Gateway/Entrypoint**: Handles incoming summarization requests.
- **Summarization Core Module**: Contains the main business logic for summarization.
- **LLM Integration Module**: Manages communication with external LLM and embedding APIs.
- **Data Persistence Module (Optional/Future)**: For storing summaries, user configurations, or usage logs.

## Functional Validation
- **Validated Against:** STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-001.md, STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-002.md, STORY-AI-SUMMARIZATION-003.md
- **Architectural Implications:** The modular monolith pattern with external LLM integrations supports the core summarization functionality, including different length preferences and viewing summaries. The API-driven approach ensures compatibility with future UI components.
