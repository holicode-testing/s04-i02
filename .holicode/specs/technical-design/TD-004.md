# TD-004: Integration & API Architecture

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  

## Executive Summary
This document defines the integration and API architecture for the AI-driven Content Summarization service. It outlines how the service will expose its functionality to consumers and how it will interact with external LLM and embedding APIs, emphasizing clear contracts and robust communication patterns.

## API Design Patterns
**Chosen Pattern:** RESTful API for external consumption, with internal module-to-module communication via direct function calls or in-process event emitters (within the Modular Monolith).
- **Rationale:**
    - **Simplicity & Familiarity:** RESTful APIs are widely understood and easy to consume, enabling rapid integration by future frontend applications or other services.
    - **Modularity:** Internal communication patterns within the monolith will ensure clear boundaries between modules while maintaining performance.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option A: GraphQL**
  - Pros: Efficient data fetching, reduces over-fetching/under-fetching, strong typing.
  - Cons: Steeper learning curve for consumers, requires a more complex server implementation.
  - Rejected because: Adds unnecessary complexity for an MVP, REST provides sufficient flexibility for initial needs.

- **Option B: gRPC**
  - Pros: High performance, efficient serialization, strong contract enforcement.
  - Cons: Requires client-side code generation, less human-readable, not natively supported by browsers.
  - Rejected because: Over-engineering for the current scope, primarily suitable for high-performance microservices communication.

**Trade-offs:**
- REST can lead to over-fetching or multiple round-trips for complex data graphs, but this is mitigated by keeping API endpoints focused and simple for the MVP.

## Service Communication Patterns
- **External:** Synchronous HTTP/HTTPS requests (RESTful API).
- **Internal (within Monolith):** Direct function calls for tightly coupled operations; in-process event emitters for looser coupling between modules if needed (e.g., for notifications or side effects).

## External System Integrations and Contracts
- **LLM APIs (OpenAI, OpenRouter, LM Studio endpoints):**
    - **Contract:** Adherence to the OpenAI API specification for text completion/chat completion and embedding endpoints.
    - **Communication:** Synchronous HTTP POST requests to the `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/embeddings` endpoints.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, including retries for transient errors, exponential backoff, and circuit breakers where appropriate to prevent cascading failures.
    - **Rate Limiting:** Respect provider-specific rate limits; implement client-side rate limiting or throttling if necessary.
- **Embedding/Reranking APIs (for llama.cpp, ollama, lm server):**
    - **Contract:** Compatible with standard embedding API specifications (e.g., OpenAI's embedding API).
    - **Communication:** Synchronous HTTP POST requests.
    - **Considerations:** May require specific model loading or endpoint configuration depending on the local server setup.

## Data Exchange Formats and Protocols
- **Primary Format:** JSON for all API requests and responses (both external and internal API boundaries).
- **Protocol:** HTTPS for all external communication to ensure data encryption in transit.

## API Versioning and Evolution Strategy
- **Initial Approach:** No explicit versioning for the MVP. Assume a single version (`v1`) as development is rapid and breaking changes can be coordinated internally.
- **Future Strategy:** If the API is exposed to external consumers or undergoes significant changes, consider:
    - **URI Versioning:** `api/v1/summarize` (simple, clear).
    - **Header Versioning:** `Accept-Version: v1` (cleaner URIs).
    - **Backward Compatibility:** Strive for backward compatibility for minor changes; for breaking changes, introduce a new version.

## Security Considerations (Integration Specific)
- **API Key Management:** API keys for external LLM services will be treated as sensitive secrets and managed according to `TD-005: Security & Compliance Architecture`.
- **Input Validation:** All incoming API requests will undergo strict input validation to prevent injection attacks or malformed data.
- **Output Sanitization:** Summarized content will be treated as untrusted input and sanitized before display or storage if it's ever reflected back to users without proper escaping.
