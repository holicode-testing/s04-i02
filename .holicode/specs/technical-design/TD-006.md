# TD-006: Performance & Scalability Architecture

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the performance and scalability architecture for the AI-driven Content Summarization service. It focuses on meeting initial MVP requirements while laying the groundwork for future growth, leveraging the Modular Monolith pattern and GCP Cloud Run capabilities.

## Performance Targets and Budgets
- **Initial MVP Target:**
    - **Latency:** Aim for summarization requests to complete within 5-10 seconds for typical content sizes. This includes round-trip time to the LLM API.
    - **Throughput:** Support a low to moderate number of concurrent requests (e.g., 5-10 concurrent users) for initial testing and internal use.
- **Future Considerations:** Performance targets will be refined based on actual usage patterns, user feedback, and business growth. Specific SLAs will be defined for production.

## Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal Scaling (Primary):**
    - **Cloud Run (Future):** Automatic horizontal scaling of service instances based on request load. Cloud Run can scale from zero to many instances, handling fluctuating demand efficiently.
    - **Docker (Local):** `docker-compose` allows for easy replication of service instances during local development and testing to simulate load.
- **Vertical Scaling (Secondary):**
    - **Cloud Run (Future):** Configuration of CPU and memory allocated per Cloud Run instance can be adjusted to handle more demanding requests.
    - **Node.js:** Leveraging Node.js's asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model maximizes throughput for I/O-bound tasks like LLM API calls.
- **LLM API Scaling:** Rely on the scalability of the external LLM providers. Implement retry mechanisms and exponential backoff to handle transient API issues or rate limiting.

## Load Balancing and Distribution Approach
- **Cloud Run (Future):** Cloud Run inherently handles load balancing across its service instances.
- **API Gateway (Future):** If a dedicated API Gateway (e.g., GCP API Gateway or Apigee) is introduced in front of the Cloud Run service, it will provide additional load balancing, routing, and traffic management capabilities.
- **Local Development:** `docker-compose` manages network routing to local service instances.

## Caching and Optimization Patterns
- **Initial MVP:** No aggressive caching implemented initially. Performance will primarily depend on LLM API response times.
- **Future Optimization:**
    - **Response Caching:** If summarization results for identical content are frequently requested, an in-memory cache (`node-cache`) or a distributed cache (e.g., Redis via GCP Memorystore) could be introduced.
    - **LLM Call Caching:** Cache responses from LLM APIs for identical prompts to reduce redundant calls and costs.
    - **Asynchronous Processing:** For very large content or bulk summarization, consider offloading to a background process (e.g., using Cloud Tasks or Cloud Pub/Sub with a Cloud Function worker) to avoid blocking the main API request.
    - **Content Pre-processing:** Optimize content sent to LLM for summarization (e.g., tokenization, chunking) to reduce input size and potentially improve LLM response times.

## Performance Monitoring and Testing Strategy
- **Monitoring (Future GCP):**
    - **GCP Cloud Monitoring:** Collect metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, request latency, error rates) for Cloud Run instances.
    - **Custom Metrics:** Implement custom application metrics to track key performance indicators (e.g., LLM API call duration, summarization processing time).
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging of request durations and errors will aid in identifying performance bottlenecks (`TD-007`).
- **Load Testing:**
    - **Local:** Use tools like `k6` or `Apache JMeter` to simulate load against the local development environment.
    - **Future GCP:** Conduct load testing against staging environments on Cloud Run to validate scalability and performance under realistic conditions.
- **Profiling:** Use Node.js built-in profiler or external tools to identify CPU hotspots and memory leaks during development.
