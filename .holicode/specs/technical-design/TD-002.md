# TD-002: Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the infrastructure and deployment strategy for the AI-driven Content Summarization service. The initial focus is on establishing a highly effective and lean local development environment to enable rapid iteration on business features. Future iterations will leverage Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, primarily Cloud Run, for staging and production deployment, for which the architecture is designed to be compatible.

## Deployment Strategy
**Chosen Approach (Future Iterations):** Container-based deployment on GCP Cloud Run.

**Rationale (for future GCP deployment):**
- **Simplicity & Speed:** Cloud Run allows for rapid deployment of containerized applications without managing underlying infrastructure, aligning with the fast-paced MVP development.
- **Scalability:** Automatically scales from zero to many instances based on demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization and handling of varying loads.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-per-use model (billable only when handling requests) is ideal for fluctuating workloads and MVP budget.
- **Managed Service:** Reduces operational overhead, freeing up the team to focus on core development.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option A: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
  - Pros: High flexibility, fine-grained control over infrastructure, suited for complex microservices architectures.
  - Cons: Higher operational complexity, steeper learning curve, increased management overhead compared to Cloud Run.
  - Rejected because: Over-engineering for an MVP modular monolith, contradicts the "lean local development" and "fast-paced" team priorities.

- **Option B: Google Cloud Functions (GCF)**
  - Pros: Fully serverless, event-driven, minimal management, very cost-effective for short-lived, event-triggered tasks.
  - Cons: Less suitable for long-running processes or applications with complex internal state, cold start issues can be more pronounced for certain use cases.
  - Rejected because: While useful for specific functions, the modular monolith pattern is better suited for Cloud Run, which handles HTTP requests more directly and allows for more complex application logic within a single service.

**Trade-offs:**
- While Cloud Run offers excellent horizontal scalability, vertical scaling (resource limits per instance) is a consideration. However, this aligns with the modular monolith approach where heavy computational tasks might be offloaded or handled by specialized services in the future.
- Abstraction from underlying infrastructure means less control over specific OS-level configurations, but this is an acceptable trade-off for reduced operational burden.

## Cloud Strategy
- **Approach:** Cloud-agnostic architecture pattern with a GCP preference.
- **Vendor Independence:** Design principles will aim for minimal vendor lock-in where feasible. Containerization (Docker) promotes portability. LLM integrations are via generic API calls (e.g., OpenAI API compatible), allowing for easy switching between providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, LM Studio).
- **Portability:** The modular design of the monolith and the use of containerization will facilitate potential migration to other cloud providers (e.g., AWS Fargate, Azure Container Apps) if strategic needs arise in the future.

## Environment Strategy
- **Development (Local):**
    - Developers will run the modular monolith application locally within Docker containers to replicate the future Cloud Run environment as closely as possible.
    - Local LLM models (e.g., via LM Studio or Ollama) can be used for development and testing to reduce reliance on external APIs during rapid iteration and enable offline development.
    - `docker-compose` will be used for orchestrating local services and dependencies, providing a consistent and isolated development environment.

- **Staging (Future Iteration):**
    - A dedicated GCP project or environment will host a staging instance of the application on Cloud Run.
    - This environment will use actual external LLM APIs and other GCP services to simulate production conditions.
    - Used for integration testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and final validation before production deployment.
- **Production (Future Iteration):**
    - The live application will be deployed to a production-grade GCP project on Cloud Run.
    - Strict monitoring, logging, and alerting will be in place.
    - API keys and sensitive configurations will be managed securely using GCP Secret Manager.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Future Iteration)
- **Principles:** Declarative, version-controlled, reproducible infrastructure provisioning.
- **Approach:** Terraform will be the primary IaC tool for defining and managing GCP resources (Cloud Run services, Secret Manager, networking, IAM roles, etc.). This ensures consistency across environments and enables automated deployment.
- **Version Control:** All IaC configurations will be stored in a Git repository, allowing for change tracking, collaboration, and rollbacks.
