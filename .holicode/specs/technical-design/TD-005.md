# TD-005: Security & Compliance Architecture

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the security and compliance architecture for the AI-driven Content Summarization service. It focuses on protecting sensitive data, securing access to external LLM APIs, and ensuring the integrity of the summarization process, while acknowledging the MVP stage of development.

## Authentication
- **Internal (Service-to-Service within Monolith):** Direct function calls and module boundaries enforce access control.
- **External (API Consumers):** For the MVP, a simple API key or token-based authentication mechanism will be implemented. This will be sufficient for internal consumption by a frontend application.
    - **Future Considerations:** For external public APIs or more robust security, consider OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.

## Authorization
- **Internal:** Not explicitly required for the MVP within the modular monolith, as module boundaries implicitly define access.
- **External:** If different levels of access are needed for the API, basic role-based access control (RBAC) could be implemented based on the API key/token used.
    - **Future Considerations:** Granular permissions and more complex RBAC models would be explored if the service is exposed to diverse user roles.

## Data Protection
- **Data in Transit:** All external communication (API calls to/from the service, and to LLM providers) will use HTTPS/TLS to ensure encryption in transit.
- **Data at Rest:**
    - For the MVP, if any summaries or related data are persisted locally (e.g., file-based), standard file system permissions will be applied.
    - For future GCP persistence (e.g., Cloud SQL, Firestore), data encryption at rest will be enabled by default through GCP's managed services.
- **Content Sensitivity:** The nature of the content being summarized should be considered. If highly sensitive data is processed, additional measures like data anonymization or redaction might be required. For the MVP, it's assumed content sensitivity is managed at the source before being sent to the summarization service.

## Input Validation
- **Strict Validation:** All input to the summarization API (e.g., text content, desired length) will be rigorously validated to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as:
    - **Injection Attacks:** Ensuring that input data cannot be interpreted as code or commands.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Limiting input size to prevent excessive resource consumption.
    - **Malformed Data:** Rejecting requests that do not conform to expected data structures.

## Secrets Management
- **LLM API Keys:**
    - **Local Development:** API keys will be stored in environment variables (e.g., `.env` files) and excluded from version control (`.gitignore`). Developers will be instructed on secure handling practices.
    - **Future GCP Deployment:** GCP Secret Manager will be used to securely store and manage LLM API keys and other sensitive configurations. Access to these secrets will be controlled via IAM policies, granting only necessary service accounts access.
- **Other Credentials:** Any other credentials (e.g., database connection strings, if applicable) will follow the same principles of secure storage and access control.

## Audit Trail & Logging
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging of API requests, responses (excluding sensitive data), errors, and system events will be implemented.
- **Audit:** Logs will contain sufficient information for debugging and basic auditing purposes (e.g., request IDs, timestamps, source IP).
- **Future Considerations:** For compliance or more detailed auditing, logs might be sent to a centralized logging solution (e.g., GCP Cloud Logging with export to BigQuery) with proper access controls and retention policies.

## Compliance Requirements
- **Initial MVP:** No specific regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) is required at this stage. Focus is on fundamental security best practices.
- **Future Iterations:** As the project matures and handles more sensitive data or expands into regulated industries, specific compliance requirements will be assessed and integrated into the architecture.

## Threat Model (High-Level)
- **External API Abuse:** Unauthorized access to the summarization API.
- **LLM API Key Compromise:** Unauthorized use of LLM service accounts.
- **Input Manipulation:** Malicious input leading to unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion.
- **Data Leakage:** Unintended exposure of processed content or sensitive data.
- **Mitigation:** Adherence to the principles outlined above (authentication, input validation, secrets management, HTTPS).
