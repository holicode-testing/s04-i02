**Complexity:** 3 (medium)

## Description
Develop a simple user interface in the React `web` application. This UI will include a text input area for users to enter content, a button to trigger the summarization process by calling the `/summarize` API endpoint, and a display area for the returned summary. The summary should be immediately displayed in a clear and readable format.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A text input field is present for users to enter content for summarization.
- [ ] A button or equivalent UI element exists to initiate the summarization process.
- [ ] Clicking the button sends the input text to the `/summarize` API endpoint.
- [ ] The returned summary is immediately displayed in a dedicated area on the UI.
- [ ] The displayed summary is presented in a clear, readable, and appropriately formatted manner (e.g., plain text).

## Validation Steps
1. Start both the `api` and `web` applications.
2. Navigate to the `web` application in a browser.
3. Enter sample text into the input field and click the summarization button.
4. Verify that the API call is made successfully and the summary is displayed on the UI.
5. Test with various inputs to ensure the display is consistently clear and readable.
