## Task: Implement Basic RESTful API Structure in `api` application

**Type:** architectural
**Source:** TD-004 (RESTful API for external consumption), TD-007 (Health Check endpoint)
**Complexity:** 2 (simple)
**Coupling Policy:** sequential
**Blocks:** TASK-005, TASK-006, TASK-008, TASK-F-001
**Depends On:** TASK-001

## Description
Set up the foundational RESTful API structure within the NestJS `api` application. This includes creating a basic controller and service for a placeholder endpoint (e.g., `/health`) to verify the API is running and responsive.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A NestJS controller is created in the `api` application.
- [ ] A corresponding NestJS service is created.
- [ ] A basic GET endpoint (e.g., `/health`) is implemented that returns a success status (e.g., 200 OK).
- [ ] The API application starts successfully and the endpoint is accessible.

## Validation Steps
1. Start the `api` application (e.g., via `nx serve api` or `docker-compose up`).
2. Send a GET request to the `/health` endpoint (e.g., `curl http://localhost:3000/health`).
3. Verify that the endpoint returns a 200 OK status and an appropriate response body.
