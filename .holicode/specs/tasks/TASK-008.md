## Task: Implement Structured Logging in `api` application

**Type:** architectural
**Source:** TD-007 (Structured Logging)
**Complexity:** 2 (simple)
**Coupling Policy:** sequential
**Blocks:** N/A
**Depends On:** TASK-004

## Description
Integrate a structured logging library (e.g., Winston or Pino) in the NestJS `api` application to output logs in JSON format to the console. This will facilitate easier parsing and analysis during local development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A structured logging library is integrated into the `api` application.
- [ ] Logs are output in JSON format to the console.
- [ ] Log entries include basic information such as timestamp, log level, and message.
- [ ] The logger can be used to log messages from controllers and services.

## Validation Steps
1. Start the `api` application.
2. Trigger some API requests or internal logic that generates log messages.
3. Observe the console output and verify that logs are in JSON format and contain the expected fields.
4. Test different log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) and confirm they are correctly displayed.
