## Task: Configure Code Quality Tools (ESLint, Prettier) in Monorepo

**Type:** architectural
**Source:** TD-003 (ESLint, Prettier)
**Complexity:** 2 (simple)
**Coupling Policy:** sequential
**Blocks:** N/A
**Depends On:** TASK-001

## Description
Integrate and configure ESLint and Prettier across the Nx monorepo for consistent code style and quality enforcement. This includes setting up configuration files and integrating them with Nx.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ESLint is configured to lint TypeScript files in both `api` and `web` applications.
- [ ] Prettier is configured to format code consistently across the monorepo.
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configurations are integrated with Nx and can be run via `nx lint` and `nx format` commands.
- [ ] No linting or formatting errors are reported on the newly generated Nx applications.

## Validation Steps
1. Execute `nx lint api` and `nx lint web` and ensure no errors.
2. Execute `nx format check` and `nx format write` to verify formatting.
3. Introduce a deliberate linting error or formatting issue and confirm that ESLint/Prettier catches it.
