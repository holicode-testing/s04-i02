## Task: Setup Nx Monorepo with TypeScript and Initial Applications

**Type:** architectural
**Source:** TD-001 (Modular Monolith), TD-002 (Nx for monorepo management), TD-003 (Node.js/TypeScript, NestJS, React, pnpm)
**Complexity:** 3 (medium)
**Coupling Policy:** none
**Blocks:** TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004, TASK-006, TASK-007, TASK-008

## Description
Initialize an Nx monorepo configured for TypeScript. This includes creating the `api` application (using NestJS), the `web` application (using React), and a `shared` library for common types and models. `pnpm` will be configured as the default package manager for the monorepo.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] An Nx monorepo is initialized at the project root.
- [ ] The monorepo is configured to use TypeScript.
- [ ] An `api` application is created within the monorepo, using NestJS.
- [ ] A `web` application is created within the monorepo, using React.
- [ ] A `shared` library is created for common types and models.
- [ ] `pnpm` is configured as the default package manager for the monorepo.
- [ ] Basic `nx test` and `nx build` commands for the `api` and `web` applications execute successfully.

## Validation Steps
1. Run `pnpm install` in the monorepo root.
2. Execute `nx build api` and `nx build web` to ensure successful compilation.
3. Execute `nx test api` and `nx test web` to ensure successful test execution.
4. Verify the `apps/api`, `apps/web`, and `libs/shared` directories exist with their respective boilerplate code.
