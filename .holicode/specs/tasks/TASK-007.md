## Task: Setup Testing Framework (Jest/Vitest) in Monorepo

**Type:** architectural
**Source:** TD-003 (Jest/Vitest), TD-006 (Load Testing - local implies testing setup)
**Complexity:** 2 (simple)
**Coupling Policy:** sequential
**Blocks:** N/A
**Depends On:** TASK-001

## Description
Configure Jest or Vitest for unit and integration testing across the Nx monorepo. This involves setting up the test environment for both `api` (NestJS) and `web` (React) applications.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Jest or Vitest is installed and configured for the `api` application.
- [ ] Jest or Vitest is installed and configured for the `web` application.
- [ ] Basic unit tests can be written and executed for both applications using `nx test`.
- [ ] Test commands are integrated into the Nx workspace.

## Validation Steps
1. Run `nx test api` and `nx test web` to ensure the testing framework is correctly set up and executes default tests.
2. Write a simple, new unit test in both `api` and `web` applications and verify it passes.
