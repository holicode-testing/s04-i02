## Task: Dockerize Monorepo Applications for Local Development

**Type:** architectural
**Source:** TD-002 (Docker, docker-compose), TD-003 (Docker, docker-compose, .env files), TD-005 (Local secrets management)
**Complexity:** 3 (medium)
**Coupling Policy:** sequential
**Blocks:** N/A
**Depends On:** TASK-001

## Description
Create Dockerfiles for the `api` and `web` applications within the Nx monorepo. Set up a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate these services for local development, including basic `.env` file setup for local secrets. Ensure `.gitignore` is updated to exclude `.env` files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `Dockerfile` exists for the `api` application, enabling it to be built into a Docker image.
- [ ] A `Dockerfile` exists for the `web` application, enabling it to be built into a Docker image.
- [ ] A `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to build and run both `api` and `web` services.
- [ ] The `docker-compose.yml` configuration supports loading environment variables from `.env` files.
- [ ] `.gitignore` is updated to include entries for `.env` files (e.g., `.env`, `.env.local`).
- [ ] Both `api` and `web` applications can be successfully started using `docker-compose up`.

## Validation Steps
1. Create a sample `.env` file for the `api` and `web` applications with a placeholder variable.
2. Run `docker-compose build` to build the images.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services in detached mode.
4. Verify that both `api` and `web` containers are running.
5. Check that the `.env` file is excluded from Git tracking.
