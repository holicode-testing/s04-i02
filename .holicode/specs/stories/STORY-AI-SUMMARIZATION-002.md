## User Story
As a learner, I want to specify the length and format of a summary so that I can tailor the summary to my specific learning needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1:** Given I have input text and options for summary length (e.g., short, medium, long) and format (e.g., bullet points, paragraph), when I select my preferred options and submit for summarization, then the system generates a summary adhering to my chosen length and format.
- **AC2:** Given the system generates a summary based on my preferences, when I review the summary, then it accurately reflects the core message and key details of the original content, tailored to the specified output.
- **AC3:** Given I request a summary length or format that is unfeasible for the provided input text (e.g., "long" summary of a single sentence), when I submit for summarization, then the system produces the closest possible summary to my preference and informs me if it could not perfectly meet the request, explaining why.
