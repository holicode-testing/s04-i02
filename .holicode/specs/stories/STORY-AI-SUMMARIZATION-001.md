## User Story
As a learner, I want to get a quick summary of any text so that I can efficiently understand the main points of learning materials.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1:** Given I have a piece of text, when I submit it for summarization, then the system displays a concise, default summary of the text.
- **AC2:** Given a summary is generated, when I review the summary, then it accurately reflects the core message and key details of the original content.
- **AC3:** Given I provide text that exceeds the system's processing limits, when I submit it for summarization, then the system gracefully informs me that the content is too long and suggests trying a shorter version.
