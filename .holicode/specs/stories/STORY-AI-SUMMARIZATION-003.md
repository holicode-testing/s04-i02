## User Story
As a learner, I want to view generated summaries clearly and easily within the learning interface so that I can quickly consume the summarized content.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1:** Given a summary has been successfully generated, when the summarization process completes, then the generated summary is immediately displayed to me in the learning interface.
- **AC2:** Given a summary is displayed, when I review the summary, then it is presented in a clear, readable, and appropriately formatted manner (e.g., bullet points if requested, paragraphs if requested).
- **AC3:** Given a summary is displayed, when I view the summary, then it is clearly associated with the original content it was generated from (e.g., via a title or snippet of the source text).
