# Work Specification: HoliCode Framework

**Status:** active  
**Created:** 2025-08-04  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Total Context Size:** <2KB (optimized for AI context loading)

## Project Overview
AI-assisted development framework with specification-driven workflows and chunked architecture for optimal context management.

## Features
<!-- Feature chunks (<1KB each) - Single Discovery Entry Point -->

## Active Stories  
<!-- Story chunks (<1KB each) linked to parent features -->

## Current Tasks
<!-- Task chunks (<1KB each) with dependency tracking -->

## Technical Design Documents
<!-- Links to TD documents processed by implementation-plan workflow -->
### Processed TDs
<!-- Track which TDs have been converted to tasks to prevent duplicates -->

### Unprocessed TDs
<!-- TDs waiting for task generation -->

## Implementation Status
<!-- Component references as they are implemented -->
### Completed Components

### In Progress Components

### Planned Components

## Hierarchy Map
<!-- Visual representation of chunk relationships for quick navigation -->

## Context Optimization Notes
- **Chunked Architecture**: Each specification chunk <1KB for optimal AI context loading
- **Single Discovery**: This manifest serves as the single entry point for all specifications
- **Hierarchical Linking**: Clear parent-child relationships between chunks
- **Live SPECs**: Implementation specifications co-located with code in src/**/SPEC.md

## Validation Status
- [ ] All chunks validate against .holicode/specs/SCHEMA.md
- [ ] Hierarchical links resolve correctly
- [ ] No orphaned specifications
- [ ] Component SPECs exist for all referenced components
