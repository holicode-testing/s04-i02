# FEATURE-AI-FEEDBACK-003: Real-time Constructive Feedback

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Business Owner:** AI Research Lead  

## Business Value
This feature provides learners with immediate, personalized, and actionable feedback on their responses to exercises and questions, fostering deeper understanding and accelerating the learning process.

## Success Metrics
- **Feedback Quality:** AI-generated feedback on quizzes/exercises is rated as "clear and constructive" in at least 80% of cases.
- **Learning Outcome:** Learners improve their score on subsequent attempts of similar questions by an average of 15% after receiving AI feedback.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Real-time feedback generation for multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions.
- Feedback explains why an answer is correct or incorrect, and provides hints for improvement.
- Integration with the learning interface to display feedback contextually.

**Out of Scope:**
- Feedback for complex, open-ended responses (e.g., essays, coding solutions).
- Peer-to-peer feedback mechanisms.
- Automated grading or scoring of responses.

## Design Rationale
**Why this approach:** Immediate and specific feedback is crucial for effective learning. AI can provide this at scale, overcoming limitations of human instructors.
**Alternatives considered:** Delayed, human-generated feedback; Why rejected: Not scalable, less immediate impact.
**Trade-offs:** Balancing depth of feedback with generation speed and computational cost.
**Security:** Ensure user responses and AI feedback are handled securely and privately, especially for sensitive topics.
