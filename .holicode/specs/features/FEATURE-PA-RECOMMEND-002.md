# FEATURE-PA-RECOMMEND-002: Personalized Content Recommendation Engine

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Business Owner:** Product Manager - Personalization  

## Business Value
This feature proactively suggests highly relevant educational content to learners, increasing engagement, accelerating discovery of new topics, and deepening their understanding by providing tailored resources.

## Success Metrics
- **Recommendation Click-Through Rate:** 20% of recommended content is clicked by learners.
- **Learner Engagement:** Average session duration increases by 20% due to relevant recommendations.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Development of a recommendation engine that suggests content based on:
    - Learner's historical activity (completed content, search queries).
    - Learner's explicit preferences (topics, content types).
    - Collaborative filtering (what similar learners found useful).
- Display of recommendations in dedicated sections within the learning interface.

**Out of Scope:**
- Real-time, dynamic recommendations that adapt within a single learning session.
- Recommendations for external content sources not ingested by the platform.
- Integration with external advertising or sponsored content networks.

## Design Rationale
**Why this approach:** Personalized recommendations are a key driver of engagement and help learners navigate vast content libraries efficiently, preventing choice paralysis.
**Alternatives considered:** Manual curation of "popular" content; Why rejected: Lacks personalization and scalability.
**Trade-offs:** Balancing algorithm complexity and computational resources with the accuracy and diversity of recommendations.
**Security:** Ensure user data used for recommendations is anonymized and privacy-compliant.
