# FEATURE-PA-PROFILE-003: User Learning Profile Management

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Business Owner:** Product Manager - Personalization  

## Business Value
This feature provides a centralized system for capturing and managing learner data, enabling the platform to build rich user profiles that power personalization, adaptive learning paths, and targeted feedback.

## Success Metrics
- **Profile Completeness:** 90% of active users have a complete learning profile (e.g., interests, goals, performance data).
- **Data Consistency:** 99% consistency in user data across integrated systems.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Secure storage of user demographic data, learning preferences, and skill assessments.
- Integration with progress tracking and AI feedback systems to update user performance data.
- API for other platform components to access and update user profile information.
- Basic user interface for learners to view and update their own preferences.

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced data analytics or reporting tools for administrators on user profiles.
- Direct integration with external user management systems (e.g., SSO providers).
- Complex user segmentation or cohort analysis.

## Design Rationale
**Why this approach:** A robust user profile is the foundation for all personalization and adaptive learning features. It centralizes critical data for the learning companion.
**Alternatives considered:** Decentralized user data across components; Why rejected: Inconsistent data, difficult to manage and scale personalization.
**Trade-offs:** Data collection and privacy considerations vs. the benefits of deep personalization.
**Security:** Strict access controls, encryption, and anonymization for sensitive user data. Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
