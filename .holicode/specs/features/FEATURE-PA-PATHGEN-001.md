# FEATURE-PA-PATHGEN-001: Adaptive Learning Path Generation

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Business Owner:** Product Manager - Personalization  

## Business Value
This feature dynamically creates personalized learning paths for each user, optimizing their educational journey based on their performance, preferences, and learning objectives, leading to more efficient and engaging learning.

## Success Metrics
- **Learning Path Relevance:** Learners rate personalized path suggestions as "highly relevant and effective" in at least 75% of interactions.
- **Path Completion Rate:** 60% of learners complete at least one suggested learning path.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Generation of sequential learning paths based on user's initial assessment, progress, and topic interests.
- Integration with content management and AI feedback systems to adapt paths in real-time.
- Visual representation of the learning path and current progress within the UI.

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced pedagogical models for learning path optimization (e.g., spaced repetition scheduling).
- Group learning paths or collaborative path generation.
- Manual path creation or modification by educators.

## Design Rationale
**Why this approach:** Adaptive paths are central to personalized learning, addressing the generic content delivery problem by providing a tailored roadmap for each learner.
**Alternatives considered:** Static, predefined learning paths; Why rejected: Does not cater to individual needs and progress.
**Trade-offs:** Complexity of algorithm design and data integration vs. significant improvements in learner engagement and outcomes.
**Security:** Ensure sensitive user performance and preference data used for path generation is handled securely and ethically.
