# FEATURE-EA-TRACKING-002: Progress Tracking & Reporting

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Business Owner:** Product Manager - Engagement  

## Business Value
This feature allows learners to monitor their progress and achievements, providing motivation and a clear understanding of their learning journey, while also offering administrators insights into overall user engagement and content effectiveness.

## Success Metrics
- **Learner Engagement:** Average session duration increases by 20% and completion rate of suggested learning modules improves by 10%.
- **Reporting Accuracy:** 99% accuracy in reported learner progress data.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Tracking of completed content, quiz scores, and learning path progress.
- Display of personal progress dashboards for learners (e.g., completion percentages, badges/milestones).
- Basic reporting functionalities for administrators (e.g., active users, popular content).
- Integration with user learning profiles and content metadata.

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced predictive analytics on learner performance or dropout rates.
- Integration with external LMS/LXP systems for progress synchronization.
- Complex data visualization tools for administrators.

## Design Rationale
**Why this approach:** Clear progress tracking motivates learners and provides valuable data for platform improvement.
**Alternatives considered:** No explicit progress tracking; Why rejected: Leads to learner disengagement and lack of data for optimization.
**Trade-offs:** Granularity of tracking data vs. storage and processing overhead.
**Security:** Ensure sensitive learner performance data is secured and accessible only to authorized individuals.
