# FEATURE-EA-ANALYTICS-003: Platform Usage & Performance Analytics

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Business Owner:** Product Manager - Engagement  

## Business Value
This feature provides critical insights into platform usage patterns, content effectiveness, and system performance, enabling data-driven decisions for continuous improvement, optimization, and strategic planning.

## Success Metrics
- **System Stability:** The platform maintains 99.95% uptime and processes requests within acceptable latency during simulated peak loads.
- **Data Availability:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) and usage metrics are available in dashboards within 1 hour of data generation.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Collection and aggregation of anonymous platform usage data (e.g., page views, feature interactions, session duration).
- Monitoring of system performance metrics (e.g., response times, error rates, resource utilization).
- Basic dashboards and reports for administrators to visualize key metrics.
- Integration with logging and monitoring infrastructure.

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced business intelligence tools or custom report generation for external stakeholders.
- Real-time anomaly detection or predictive analytics for system failures.
- Direct integration with external marketing or sales analytics platforms.

## Design Rationale
**Why this approach:** Data-driven decision-making is crucial for platform growth and optimization. Understanding how users interact with the platform and how the system performs is fundamental.
**Alternatives considered:** Relying solely on external analytics tools; Why rejected: Less integrated, potential data silos, limited control over data collection.
**Trade-offs:** Granularity of data collection vs. storage costs and processing overhead.
**Security:** Ensure collected data is anonymized where appropriate, and access to sensitive performance/usage data is restricted. Compliance with data retention policies.
