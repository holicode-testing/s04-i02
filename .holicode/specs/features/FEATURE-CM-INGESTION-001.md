# FEATURE-CM-INGESTION-001: Content Ingestion Pipeline

**Status:** draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Business Owner:** Content Team Lead  

## Business Value
This feature enables the automated and semi-automated intake of diverse educational content, reducing manual effort and expanding the breadth of available learning materials on the platform.

## Success Metrics
- **Ingestion Rate:** System can process and categorize 50 new educational resources per hour.
- **Error Rate:** Less than 1% of ingested content fails processing due to ingestion pipeline issues.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Development of a pipeline to ingest various content formats (e.g., text, video, audio, interactive exercises).
- Basic content parsing and extraction of raw text/media.
- Initial classification and tagging based on predefined rules.

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced AI-driven content analysis during ingestion (e.g., deep semantic understanding).
- Complex content transformation or normalization for different learning contexts.
- Real-time content updates from external sources.

## Design Rationale
**Why this approach:** Focusing on a robust ingestion pipeline first ensures a steady supply of content for subsequent curation and AI processing. Automating the initial intake is critical for scalability.
**Alternatives considered:** Manual content upload and processing; Why rejected: Not scalable, labor-intensive.
**Trade-offs:** Initial complexity of handling diverse formats vs. long-term efficiency.
**Security:** Input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious content injection.
