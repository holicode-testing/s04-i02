## Project Brief Analysis
Based on projectbrief.md, I will analyze:

### Core Objectives Analysis
- What are the core objectives of this project?
- How do the architectural decisions support these objectives?
- Are there constraints affecting implementation choices?
- How has the project scope evolved since inception?

### Requirements Validation
- Are objectives clearly defined and measurable?
- Do current technical decisions align with business goals?
- What assumptions need validation?

## Active Context Deep Dive
Based on activeContext.md:

### Current Focus Analysis
- What specific work is being focused on right now?
- What recent changes might affect system understanding?
- What are the next steps and how do they relate to overall goals?
- Are there active decisions or considerations influencing current work?

### Decision Point Analysis  
- What decisions are pending and what information is needed?
- Are there any conflicting priorities or resource constraints?
- How do current tasks contribute to larger objectives?

## Progress & Completion Analysis
Based on progress.md:

### Status Reconciliation
- What components are complete vs. in progress?
- How do completion percentages align with described status?
- What known issues exist and how might they impact implementation?
- What dependencies exist between upcoming tasks?

### Risk Assessment
- Are there any red flags in current progress?
- What could block or delay current objectives?
- Are estimates realistic based on historical data?

## Technical Architecture Analysis
Based on systemPatterns.md and techContext.md:

### Architecture Validation
- What architectural patterns are being employed and why?
- How do components relate to each other?
- What technical decisions have been made and their rationale?
- Are there design principles guiding implementation?

### Technology Assessment
- What technologies are being used and why were they chosen?
- What constraints exist in the technical environment?
- Are there integration points with external systems?
- What development setup is required?

## Cross-Document Consistency Check
### Inconsistency Detection
- Are there any inconsistencies between documents regarding status or approach?
- How do recent changes in one document affect information in others?
- Is the overall narrative cohesive across all documents?
- What information seems to be missing or underspecified?
