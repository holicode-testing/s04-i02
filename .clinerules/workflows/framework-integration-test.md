# Framework Integration Test Workflow

## Agent Identity
Role: Framework Integration Tester  
Responsibilities: Validate all Stage 4 enhancements work together cohesively  
Success Criteria: All integration points tested, metrics collected, report generated

## Purpose
Test the complete Stage 4 enhanced framework through a full cycle:
- Decision delegation framework
- Interactive participation points
- Tricky problem protocol
- Pattern library usage
- Complexity management
- SPIKE handling
- Tech review process

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Feature (Low Complexity)
1. Start with basic business brief
2. Test delegation bypass (explicit opt-out)
3. Generate single feature → story → task
4. Apply patterns from library
5. Complete without SPIKEs
6. Measure: Time, interactions, pattern reuse

### Scenario 2: Complex Feature (High Complexity)
1. Start with ambiguous business brief
2. Test interactive participation points
3. Generate multiple stories with dependencies
4. Trigger complexity scoring > 5
5. Create and execute SPIKE
6. Test tricky problem protocol
7. Complete tech review with YELLOW status
8. Measure: Escalations, SPIKE effectiveness, review accuracy

### Scenario 3: Problem Resolution
1. Simulate TypeScript augmentation issue
2. Apply pattern from library
3. If pattern fails, trigger tricky problem protocol
4. After 3 attempts, test escalation
5. Document new pattern
6. Measure: Time to resolution, pattern effectiveness

## Process

### 1. Setup Test Environment
```bash
# Create test workspace
mkdir -p test-stage4-integration
cd test-stage4-integration

# Initialize HoliCode
/state-init.md

# Configure delegation settings
# Set some decisions to delegated, others to require approval
```

### 2. Execute Test Scenarios
For each scenario:
1. Document starting conditions
2. Execute workflow sequence
3. Capture all interaction points
4. Measure key metrics
5. Validate outputs against expected

### 3. Collect Metrics
```markdown
## Metrics Collection

### Efficiency Metrics
- Time from brief to implementation plan
- Number of user interactions required
- Pattern reuse percentage
- SPIKE time box adherence

### Quality Metrics
- Specification completeness scores
- Rationale documentation coverage
- Security/reliability finding accuracy
- Tech review alignment scores

### Process Metrics
- Escalation trigger accuracy
- Problem resolution time

- Delegation override frequency
```

### 4. Generate Integration Report
```markdown
## Integration Test Report
Location: `.holicode/analysis/reports/stage4-integration-test.md`

### Test Results
- Scenario 1: [PASS/FAIL] - [Details]
- Scenario 2: [PASS/FAIL] - [Details]

### Integration Points Validated
- [ ] Delegation framework → Workflows
- [ ] Interactive points → User responses
- [ ] Complexity scoring → SPIKE creation
